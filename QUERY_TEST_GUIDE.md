## 🎯 Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
1. Open the app
2. Ask "What is the overall wave status?"
3. Verify you get a comprehensive response with specific data

### 2. Modal Test
1. Click on "Productivity Issues (24)" in Issue Summary
2. Verify modal opens with station details
3. Press ESC key to close modal
4. Verify modal closes

### 3. Station-Specific Test
1. Ask "How is station V031 performing?"
2. Verify you get specific performance data for that station
3. Ask "Which stations are starved?"
4. Verify you get a list of starved stations (should be 0)

### 4. Trend Analysis Test
1. Ask "What is the SBL productivity trend?"
2. Verify you get trend analysis with LPH values
3. Ask "What is the PTL productivity trend?"
4. Verify you get PTL trend information

### 5. Recommendations Test
1. Ask "What recommendations do you have?"
2. Verify you get actionable recommendations
3. Ask "What should I focus on?"
4. Verify you get prioritized action items

## 🚨 Expected Issues & Fixes

### If queries return generic responses:
- Check if the specific handler is matching the question
- Verify the question format matches the handler patterns
- Check if the data context is being passed correctly

### If station-specific queries fail:
- Verify the station code format (V031, V032, etc.)
- Check if the station exists in the data
- Ensure the regex pattern is working correctly

### If modal doesn't close with ESC:
- Check if the useEffect is properly set up
- Verify the event listener is being added/removed correctly

## ✅ Success Criteria

- **All 60 queries** should return specific, data-driven responses
- **No generic responses** like "I don't understand" or "I cannot answer"
- **Modal functionality** should work with both click and ESC key
- **Station-specific queries** should work for any valid station code
- **Data accuracy** should match the actual dashboard artifacts

## 🎉 Ready for Demo!

The system now handles all 60 test queries with specific, actionable responses. The modal functionality is complete with escape key support, and all query handlers are comprehensive and data-driven.

**Demo Flow:**
1. Start with "What is the overall wave status?"
2. Test station-specific queries
3. Show modal functionality
4. Test recommendations and actionable queries
5. Demonstrate trend analysis and root cause analysis
